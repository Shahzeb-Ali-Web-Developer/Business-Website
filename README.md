Working with Git has been an essential part of my development workflow, especially in collaborating on projects and maintaining a structured version control system. My experience with Git ranges from managing small personal projects to working with teams on more complex repositories.

One of the most valuable aspects of Git is the ability to track changes and roll back when necessary. For instance, branching is a feature I often use to experiment with new ideas or work on features independently without affecting the main codebase. It has allowed me to maintain clean and organized project histories.

Merging and resolving conflicts were initially challenging, but I quickly learned to break tasks into smaller commits, making conflict resolution much more manageable. Tools like GitLens in VS Code have been helpful in visualizing changes and understanding the history of files in the project.

Collaborating with others through platforms like GitHub has been a rewarding experience. Through pull requests, code reviews, and issues, Git has streamlined team communication and ensured that everyone is aligned. Learning to use Git effectively has not only improved my technical skills but has also made me more disciplined in documenting my work and maintaining clean, reliable code versions.
